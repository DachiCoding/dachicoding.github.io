Greeting!

My name is Dachi Xu, and I am a graduate student major in computer science at DePaul university. I love programming(for sure) and computer science(maybe)!

This is my website that I will blog about studing computer science ï¼Œprogramming and a lot of other stuff. And I will also put my portfolio of programming projects and my personal academic/professional track on this website. 

I hope you can enjoy hanging out here my friend! :)

Thanks,
Dachi
