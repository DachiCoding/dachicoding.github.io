<p>What I’ve studied today:</p>

<p>1.MIT OCW: Mathematics For Computer Science Lecture 4 Number Theory I</p>

<p>Let’s watch a clip from “Die Hard 3” first.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVtQNK_ZUJg">Die Hard 3 Jugs Problem</a></p>

<p>My solution is: 
1.Fill the 3 gallon jug, and pour it into the 5 gallon jug, then we have (0,3) gallons in the 3g and 5g jugs
2.Fill the 3 gallon jug again , and pour the water into the 5 gallon jug until it is full, then we have (1,5) gallons.
3.Dump all the water in the 5 gallon jug and then pour the 1 gallon of water from the 3 gallon jug to 5 gallon (1,5) -&gt; (1, 0) -&gt; (0, 1)
4.Fill the 3 gallon jug and pour all the water into the 5 gallon jug (3,1) -&gt; (0, 4).
5.Done</p>

<p>Let’s look at the problem from a more abstract perspective, can we use a 3 gallon jug and 6 gallon jug to get 4 gallons of water? 
Maybe not, “suppose that we have water jugs with capacities a and b, the amount of water in each jugs is always a linear combination 
of a and b.”</p>

<p>Below is the proof steps using induction from the MIT text-note.

<p>Ok, but why bother studying the number theory? because SECURITY matters! “Number theory underlies modern cryptography, which is what 
enable secure online communication.”</p>
