<p>What I’ve studied today:</p>

<p>1.MIT OCW: Mathematics For Computer Science Lecture 3 Strong Induction.</p>

<p>Ok, why we need to study induction?</p>

<p>According to the textbook of this course:</p>

<p>“One of the most important uses of induction in computer science involves proving that a program or process preserves
one or more desirable properties as it proceeds. A property that is preserved through a series of operations or steps 
is known as an invariant. “</p>

<p>Have you ever play the 8 puzzle game? (In China we have a similar game named “Hua Rong Dao”, which have a better UI I guess.)

<p>Whether if you are a fan of this game, let’s try to figure out whether the chart on the left could reach to the right?</p>

<p>The answer is no actually.</p>

<p>Because in the situation above there only exist one set of inversion, but a row move(moving from left to right or vice versa)does not change the 
number of inversion, and a column move(change up and down)change even number of inversion. It is unreachable to make it right by the move allowed
in this game.</p>

<p>Official proof goes here:</p>
