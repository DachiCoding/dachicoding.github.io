First of all, my apology for not updating my blog for couple of months, slap on my face!

Second, we still need make some new wishes.

Ok, I hope in 2015 I can:

1.read one book of computer science per month

2.hack one programming project per month(web or mobile or hardware)

So for january I would like to 

Read a book: Mastering TCP/IP by Takafumi Takeshita, Yukio murayama, Toru Arai, Yukio Karita

Hack a web app: Using AngularJS MVC

I wish I can keep it.

Thanks,

Dachi
