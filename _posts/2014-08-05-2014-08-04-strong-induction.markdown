What Iâ€™ve studied today:

1.MIT OCW: Mathematics For Computer Science Lecture 3 Strong Induction.

Ok, why we need to study induction?

According to the textbook of this course: 

"One of the most important uses of induction in computer science involves proving that a program or process preserves
one or more desirable properties as it proceeds. A property that is preserved through a series of operations or steps 
is known as an invariant. "

Have you ever play the 8 puzzle game? (In China we have a similar game named "Hua Rong Dao", which have a better UI I guess.)

Whether if you are a fan of this game, let's try to figure out whether the chart on the left could reach to the right?

The answer is no actually.

Because in the situation above there only exist one set of inversion, but a row move(moving from left to right or vice versa)does not change the 
number of inversion, and a column move(change up and down)change even number of inversion. It is unreachable to make it right by the move allowed
in this game.

Official proof goes here:
