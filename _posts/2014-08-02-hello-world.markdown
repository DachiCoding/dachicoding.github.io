Hi There!

This website is about how I learn computer science and make cool stuff, I will post articles about learning computer science and hacking programming projects at this site.

A few notes about the website structure:
1.Daily -> I will post something about what I learn about computer science on a daily basis(Hopefully).

2.Hack  -> I will present the track of my programming projects(web app, mobile app, hardware hacking and etc) at this section.

3.Blog  -> Comparing to the "Daily section", I will post summarized and more systematical articles here about computer science, programming or stuff about making product.

4.Dachi -> Contacts, Resume, CV and what else I would like to share with you about me.

I appreciate your visit and I hope you may enjoy it. 

Thanks,
Dachi
