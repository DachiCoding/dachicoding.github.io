Summary of what I've studied today:

**_Python_**:

Python Project Skeleton should look like this:
~/bin
~/docs
~/source
~/tests

Helpful Python packages:
# pip
# nosetest
# virtualenv

**_Vim_**:

Searching:
# /search text + ENTER
# after search use n to go to next match or ? go to previous match
# use "set hlsearch" to turn on the highlight of matched text.
# use "set incsearch" to highlight matching text as soon as you type(rather than after you press the 'ENTER')

**_LINUX_**:
# passwd: to change password of user
# useful shortcuts:
CTRL + A : go to the left side of the line.
CTRL + E : go to the right side of the line.
CTRL + D : log out or exit
CTRL + R : search command history ( you can also type 'history' to list all previous commands you typed. )
