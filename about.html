      My name is Dachi, and I am a graduate student major in computer science at DePaul university. I love programming(for sure) and computer science(maybe)!
      <br/><br/>
      This is my website that I will blog about studing computer science, programming and a lot of other stuff. And I will also put my portfolio of programming projects and my personal academic/professional track on this website.
