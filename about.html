<h3>Greeting!</h3>
<br/>
My name is Dachi, and I am a graduate student major in computer science at DePaul university. I love programming(for sure) and computer science(maybe)!
<br/><br/>
This is my website that I will blog about studing computer science, programming and a lot of other stuff. And I will also put my portfolio of programming projects and my personal academic/professional track on this website. 
<br/><br/>
I hope you can enjoy hanging out here my friend! :)
<br/><br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
Dachi
